# Master Branch Merge Preparation

## Summary
This document describes the preparation completed for merging the master branch into the main branch via the `master-merge-into-main` branch.

## Current Branch Status

### Main Branch
- Contains basic repository structure with README.md and LICENSE
- Recently merged PR #1 from copilot branch
- Minimal content, serving as target for merge

### Master Branch  
- Contains complete React Native nurse revalidation application
- ~20,490 lines of code added
- Full TypeScript/Expo implementation
- Comprehensive feature set through Stage 5 development

### Master-Merge-Into-Main Branch (Prepared)
- Successfully merged content from master branch with main branch
- Resolved README.md conflict by combining comprehensive master content with main description
- Included LICENSE file from main branch
- Fixed app.json name to match test expectations ("NMC Nurse Revalidation")
- All tests pass (Stage 1-5)
- Dependencies install successfully
- Application builds without errors

## Changes Made

1. **Conflict Resolution**: Merged README.md files to preserve comprehensive documentation from master while incorporating description from main
2. **App Configuration**: Fixed app.json name from "Nurse Revalidator" to "NMC Nurse Revalidation" to pass tests
3. **Testing**: Verified all stages 1-5 tests pass successfully
4. **Build Verification**: Confirmed npm install and basic functionality works

## Files Added/Modified in Merge

### New Files from Master:
- Complete React Native application structure
- Package.json with all dependencies
- TypeScript configuration
- Expo configuration with proper permissions
- Source code for nurse revalidation app (src/ directory)
- Test files for all development stages
- Assets (icons, images)
- .gitignore

### Modified Files:
- README.md (conflict resolved, comprehensive version retained)
- app.json (name corrected for test compatibility)

### Preserved from Main:
- LICENSE file

## Next Steps

The `master-merge-into-main` branch is now ready for creating a pull request to merge into `main`. This will:

1. Bring the complete nurse revalidation application into the main branch
2. Preserve the existing LICENSE from main
3. Provide comprehensive documentation
4. Ensure all tests pass and application builds successfully

## Technical Verification

- ✅ All Stage 1-5 tests pass
- ✅ Dependencies install without issues  
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works
- ✅ Expo configuration is valid
- ✅ No merge conflicts remain
- ✅ App builds successfully

The merge is ready to proceed via pull request workflow.
